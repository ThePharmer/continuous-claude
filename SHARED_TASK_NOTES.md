# Shared Task Notes

## Current Goal
Improve sentences in README.md (one per iteration)

## This Iteration
- Improved line 19: Prerequisites section in Quick start
- Before: "Prerequisites: Install and authenticate the [Claude Code CLI] and [GitHub CLI]. Then:"
- After: "**Prerequisites:** Install the [Claude Code CLI] and [GitHub CLI], then authenticate both (`claude auth` and `gh auth login`). Once ready:"
- Key changes: Made bold for visibility, provided specific auth commands, changed "Then:" to "Once ready:" for better flow

## Next Iteration
Pick another sentence in README.md to improve. Consider:
- Examples section (lines 44-54): Comment descriptions could be more specific about what each example demonstrates
- Lines 34-39: Flag descriptions could include more context about when/why to use each option
- Lines 7-14: The workflow steps could be more concise or use parallel structure
